Confusion in programming comes from not knowing, not having enough info, or not being able to process everything at once. These map to the brain’s LTM, STM, and working memory. All three always interact, and recognizing which one is strained helps you resolve confusion faster.
I think this will help me approach learning programming more effectively because before, I just thought of confusion as being “stuck.” Now, I can identify why I’m stuck:
If I’m missing knowledge, I know I need to study or practice.
If I’m missing information, I should look up documentation or examples.
If my processing power is overloaded, I can break problems into smaller steps, use pen and paper, or debug incrementally.
This makes the feeling of confusion less discouraging as it's not just me being “bad at coding,” but my brain using different memory systems.
examples from my experiences
Lack of Knowledge: The first time I learned Python, I didn’t know what def meant so Until I learned about functions, I couldn’t understand example programs.
Lack of Information: When I learned pointers is class, I could use it, but I was confused until I read the documentation to understand its methods.
Lack of Processing Power: While tracing my CSC 110 Blackjack project, I had trouble keeping track of card values, deck state, and player totals at once. I had to add print statements to reduce the load on my brain.
