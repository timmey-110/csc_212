# My Community Contributions 


Use this file to create a list of your contributions to the class community 

For each one: 
- Use the `Community & Explore Badge Logger` action (it helps automate these steps)

**or**

1. add an item in a bulleted list (start the line with `- ` )
1. create a link to your contribution like  `[text to display](url/of/contribution)``
1. create an individual pull request titled "Community-shortname" where `shortname` is a short name for what you did 
1. request a review on that PR from `@brownsarahm`
1. for this to count, `@brownsarahm` must approve it

<!-- notice in source view they're all 1, but they render as 1,2,3... Markdown is helpful -->

<!-- Once you start you can move those instructions to a comment like this -->
